# About the application
**Not all features are fully functioning** 
Career Cupid is designed for underrepresented communities in STEM to connect without the troubles of cold-emailing or needing an existing network. As many people say, networking is essential to a successful career so we aim to connect engineers and provide resources to close racial, gender, and equity gaps in STEM/corporate.
